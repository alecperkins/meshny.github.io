# Getting Started

There are [several wide-area LoRa mesh networks](https://coverage.nyme.sh) in the NYC metro area, using different technologies and in various states of formation. You are welcome to join any or all of them! <em>Please</em> read and follow the configuration guidelines for each one, to give yourself and everyone else an optimal experience.

Two networks use [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org), and one uses [MeshCore](https://meshcore.io). Which one you can reach depends on who else is around you. Be patient, try all three out, send hello messages to see if you are in range.


## Hardware

You will need at least a personal, handheld node that will be your direct connection to the mesh. Additionally, most people need a “roof” node to create a reliable first hop to the area infrastructure. If you want to join multiple networks at the same time, you will need a device for each.

If you don’t already have a device, see our list of [recommended complete nodes](/faq#hardware).

<br>

## Meshtastic

To connect to the wide-area Meshtastic networks in the NYC area…

1. Familiarize yourself with the technology using the [official documentation](https://meshtastic.org/docs/getting-started/)
2. Ensure your node is on the [latest Beta or Alpha firmware](https://flasher.meshtastic.org)<span class="js-mt-firmware"></span>
3. (optional) Enable LoRa &gt; Ok To MQTT to show on the [map/chat](https://meshview.nyme.sh/map)
4. Configure your node as described below, based on how you use it:
    <br/><small>Note that the config guidelines below will likely deviate from the official recommendations. This is because a large wide-area mesh network has different requirements than the more personal mesh networks Meshtastic is oriented toward by default. The configs here are tailored specifically for our use case; it makes for a good experience within the context of these networks, but may not be useful if you are using Meshtastic for personal meshes.</small>

### Personal node configuration

These are nodes that you send messages from. Either fixed or mobile.

#### Handheld node config

These are nodes that you carry with you, in your pocket, bag, belt, mounted on your car, and so on.

1. Role: <u>CLIENT_MUTE</u>
2. Position: <u>disabled</u>, or
    - <u>enable</u> smart position
        - smart interval <u>30 minutes</u> or more
        - update distance <u>100 m</u> or more
    - <u>disable</u> altitude
    - GPS polling interval: <u>30 minutes</u> or longer
3. Telemetry: <u>off</u>
4. Device info: <u>19 hour</u> interval or longer (68,400 seconds)
5. LoRa <span class="js-konami" data-alt="bunny">hop</span> limit: <u>7</u>

<details class="small">
  <summary>Explanation of the settings</summary>
  <p><code>CLIENT_MUTE</code> is the preferred starting point for mobile nodes because it avoids unexpected relay behavior in an infrastructure-based mesh. Personal or mobile nodes often experience worse SNRs than fixed nodes, which causes them to relay first and potentially stop a better-placed node from relaying. It’s also important if you have two nodes in close proximity, avoiding the <a href="https://nyme.sh/faq/#what-role-do-i-chose">“false ack”</a> problem that can hide connection issues.</p>
  <p>Smart position is preferred because it reduces the broadcasts if position hasn’t changed. However, it has trouble with altitude so it’s best to disable this—altitude is usually not helpful for mobile nodes. Generally, position doesn’t need to be sent more frequently than 30 minutes.</p>
  <p>Telemetry is disabled because we don’t need to know your battery level or channel utilization on a regular basis. Neither are meaningful to the rest of the mesh.</p>
  <p>Reducing automatic device info broadcasts avoids the throttling that inhibits the request user info features, and it makes room for more useful packets generally. Also, nodes have the ability to send node info on-demand if the operator needs to advertise their info.</p>
  <p>Personal nodes usually need more <span class="js-konami" data-alt="bunnies">hops</span> to work through the infill to get to and from the network backbone. The next-gen MediumSlow network relies on this being the maximum of <em>7</em> because the network adopts <a href="/nymesh-2/">packet-level resiliency</a> instead of link-level, and needs the additional <span class="js-konami" data-alt="bunnies">hops</span> to allow for retries and path diversity.</p>
</details>
<br>

#### Stationary personal node config

These are your base station nodes that live on your desk or your roof, _that you also send messages from_. They are nodes you connect directly to, rather than use as a relay. (If you _do not_ send messages directly from the roof node, see [below](#infrastructure-node-configuration).)

1. Role: <u>CLIENT</u>
2. Position: <u>disabled</u>, or
    - <u>disable</u> smart position
    - <u>enable</u> altitude
    - fixed position recommended
    - GPS polling interval (if applicable): <u>24 hours</u>
    - broadcast interval: <u>23 hour</u> interval or longer (82,800 seconds)
3. Telemetry: <u>off</u>.
4. Device info: <u>19 hour</u> interval or longer (68,400 seconds)
5. LoRa <span class="js-konami" data-alt="bunny">hop</span> limit: <u>7</u>

<details class="small">
  <summary>Explanation of the settings</summary>
  <p><code>CLIENT</code> is the preferred starting point for fixed personal nodes because they are likely to provide useful conditional relay.</p>
  <p>Position is optional, but helpful to understand the physical realities of the mesh. Smart position is not recommended, since the node is not moving. It can have trouble with variations from a GPS fix so it’s best to set an explicit fixed position. Altitude is helpful for understanding coverage.</p>
  <p>Telemetry is preferred disabled because others generally don’t need to know your battery level or channel utilization on a regular basis. Neither are meaningful to the rest of the mesh. The node will still relay its battery info regularly when you connect your app to it.</p>
  <p>Reducing automatic device info broadcasts avoids the throttling that inhibits the request user info features, and it makes room for more useful packets generally. Also, nodes have the ability to send node info on-demand if the operator needs to advertise their info.</p>
  <p>Personal nodes usually need more <span class="js-konami" data-alt="bunnies">hops</span> to work through the infill to get to and from the network backbone. The next-gen MediumSlow network relies on this being the maximum of <em>7</em> because the network adopts <a href="/nymesh-2/">packet-level resiliency</a> instead of link-level, and needs the additional <span class="js-konami" data-alt="bunnies">hops</span> to allow for retries and path diversity.</p>

### Infrastructure node configuration

Nodes that are in a fixed location and intended solely for relay purposes. These nodes are _not_ used to send messages directly. They typically are solar builds in remote locations. (If you _do_ send messages from the node, see [above](#stationary-personal-node-config).)

1. Role: <u>CLIENT_BASE</u><sup><a href="/faq#what-role-do-i-chose">*</a></sup>
2. Rebroadcast mode: <u>Core Portnums Only</u>
3. Is Unmessagable: <u>true</u>
4. Position:
    - <u>disable</u> smart position
    - <u>enable</u> altitude
    - fixed position recommended
    - GPS polling interval (if applicable): <u>24 hours</u>
    - broadcast interval: <u>23 hour</u> interval or longer (82,800 seconds)
5. Telemetry: at least <u>6 hour</u> interval
6. Device info: <u>47 hour</u> interval (169,200 seconds)
7. LoRa <span class="js-konami" data-alt="bunny">hop</span> limit: <u>2</u>
8. (Optional, _strongly recommended_) Enable <a href="https://meshtastic.org/docs/configuration/remote-admin/">remote admin</a>

<details class="small">
  <summary>Explanation of the settings</summary>
  <p><code>CLIENT_BASE</code> helps differentiate the infrastructure nodes from personal nodes. It also enables handy infrastructure behaviors through favoriting adjacent routers and personal nodes, features that work best when the node is in a static position. <code>CLIENT_BASE</code> is also the recommended starting point even if the node is well sited.</p>
  <p><code>Core Portnums Only</code> will prevent propagation of custom packets or noisy applications like TAK that should not be used on a wide-area mesh, and ensure airtime remains available for text.</p>
  <p>Altitude is useful for line-of-sight estimates. But smart position has trouble with altitude if it changes due to GPS variation and can spam position unnecessarily. 23 hours is sufficient to stay on the map and rotates the broadcast throughout the day.</p>
  <p>Position is highly recommended for infrastructure nodes so users can understand which nodes provide coverage for them. (It doesn’t have to be exact, but should be a useful approximation.) Fixed position is recommended even if there is GPS present. The GPS is still useful for keeping the node's clock accurate, but it can cause unexpected position variations due to errant GPS signal reception. 24 hours is sufficient to maintain the clock without a meaningful drain on the battery of solar nodes.</p>
  <p>Telemetry broadcasts are useful to monitor the health of the node, but more frequent than 6 hours is excessive and takes up useful airtime.</p>
  <p>Device info is significantly curtailed because it’s not necessary for the nodes to route packets, and takes up airtime. The odd interval allows the info broadcast to rotate throughout the day.</p>
  <p><span class="js-konami" data-alt="Bunny">Hop</span> limit: fixed nodes should focus on advertising to their immediate vicinity. They also should be within direct or single-<span class="js-konami" data-alt="bunny">hop</span> range of infrastructure, and don’t need as many <span class="js-konami" data-alt="bunnies">hops</span> to reach through the infill — they <em>are</em> the infill.</p>

### Radio settings

There are currently two different Meshtastic networks operating in the NYC area. Joining a network requires configuring your radio to use the same LoRa settings. You are free to join whichever one you can reach, or both if you have multiple devices.

<div class="callout -primary" id="mediumslow">
  <p><strong>Be a good mesh citizen:</strong> <em>Please</em> ensure your node follows the <a href="#personal-node-configuration">above configuration</a> before connecting to the network. Please do not use high-traffic applications like Reticulum or TAK on this network; they saturate the mesh and make it unusable for everyone. Sustained encrypted traffic will be detected and blocked by the infrastructure to protect the limited airtime.</p>
  <p>Current primary mesh radio settings:</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Preset</dt>
    <dd><u>Medium Range - Slow</u></dd>
    <dt>Frequency slot</dt>
    <dd><u>48</u></dd>
    <dt>Public channel name</dt>
    <dd><u>MediumSlow</u> or blank</dd>
    <dt>Public channel key</dt>
    <dd><u>1 byte</u>, <u><code>AQ==</code></u></dd>
  </dl>
  <p>
    <strong>Personal nodes: increase LoRa <span class="js-konami" data-alt="bunny">hop</span> limit to <u>7</u>.</strong> (Yes, really.)
  </p>
  <p class="small">
    This network is <a href="/preset-testing/">actively forming</a>. Not all infrastructure has moved yet. You may find it difficult to reach some parts of the network during the transition. Network status and help is available in the <a href="https://discord.nyme.sh">Discord chat</a>.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="callout" id="longfast">
  <p>Legacy network settings (LongFast):</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Preset</dt>
    <dd><u>Long Range - Fast</u></dd>
    <dt>Frequency slot</dt>
    <dd><u>20</u> or <u>0</u></dd>
    <dt>Public channel name</dt>
    <dd><u>LongFast</u> or blank</dd>
    <dt>Public channel key</dt>
    <dd><u>1 byte</u>, <u><code>AQ==</code></u></dd>
  </dl>
  <p class="small">
    These settings are the default, out-of-the-box Meshtastic settings. A bit of infrastructure is maintained on these settings to catch newcomers, travelers, and stragglers. Some users continue with this network since it provides the greater range that they need (at the expense of severe congestion).
  </p>
</div>

<details>
  <summary>Explanation of the settings</summary>
  <p>The above settings are necessary to keep the network in a high-performing state. The Meshtastic default settings are oriented toward small-scale meshes that require frequent background packets to be effective. However, on large meshes these defaults are unnecessary and quickly create congestion that compromises the utility of the network for everyone. Reducing this extraneous background traffic as much as possible is essential for preserving the usefulness of the mesh.</p>
</details>

## MeshCore

To connect to the wide-area MeshCore network in the NYC area:

1. Ensure your companion is on the [latest firmware](https://flasher.meshcore.io) <span class="js-mc-companion-firmware"></span>
2. Add hashtag channels on the MeshCore app by clicking the 3 dots at the top right of the main screen, Add Channel, then join a hashtag channel. If you click Advanced Settings under that, you have the option to add a region.
3. (recommended) Set your Path Hash Size to <u>2-byte</u> (in Experimental Settings in the app)
4. (experimental) Set region scope in channels, 3 dots in the top right while in the channel and click Set Region Scope. If there are no regions in there, click the 3 dots in the top right and click Discover Regions, and click the check mark to the regions for them to show up in the Set Region Scope menu. You can also click the 3 dots in the top right of the Set Region Scope and click clear scope to go back to default flooding. Other MeshCore client apps have a way to do this as well.

Channels:
- #hud - scoped to hud
- #nyc - scoped to nyc
- #hv - scoped to hv
- #li - scoped to li
- #testing - choose which region you want to flood too, or can be left as no scope for now
- #emergency - no scope (will change later)

<div class="callout" id="meshcore-radio-settings">
  <p>MeshCore radio settings:</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Preset</dt>

  </p>
</div>


### Repeaters

1. Familiarize yourself with the technology using the [official documentation](https://docs.meshcore.io/faq/)
2. Ensure your repeater is on the [latest firmware](https://flasher.meshcore.io) <span class="js-mc-repeater-firmware"></span>
3. Set zero-hop auto advert interval to <u>240 minutes</u> or more
4. Set flood auto advert interval to <u>47 hours</u> or more
5. Set <u>2-byte</u> prefixes for adverts: `set path.hash.mode 1` then `clock sync`
6. (<em>recommended</em>) Set advert hop limits to <u>8</u> (already the default as of 1.16): `set flood.max.advert 8`
7. (<em>experimental</em>) Set regioning as specified below:
    1. Check out the New England Mesh Map linked [here](https://newenglandme.sh/regions/map), click on your repeater location, and note down the region codes that your region falls under (e.g. Manhattans are hud, northeast, nyc, and east).
    2. If you are in range of an existing repeater and on the official MeshCore app, click the 3 dots in the top right, click Tools, then click Discover Regions. The regions that show up can be used in your repeater setup instead. Other MeshCore client apps have a way to do this as well.
    3. If you are at the edge of a region, or steps 1 and 2 give different results, you are free to combine the results, just don't list the shorthands twice.
    4. Once you have your list, run `region put <region>` for every region, then `region allowf <region>` for every region, then `region save`.
        - Example for Manhattan:
          
          `region put east`

          `region put northeast`

          `region put hud`

          `region put nyc`

          `region allowf east`

          `region allowf northeast`

          `region allowf hud`
          
          `region allowf nyc`

          `region save`


<details>
  <summary>Explanation of the settings</summary>
  <p>Advert intervals are maximized and hops curtailed to reduce the airtime load on the mesh. The odd number of 47 ensures the flood adverts of the repeater rotate through the day over time, to avoid people missing it because they are only in an area at certain times of day. Packets can get routed and paths discovered even without hearing the adverts; knowing the full ID and name of the repeater is informational only. 2-byte prefixes are recommended to reduce chance of ID collision with other repeaters, for clarity and optimal routing, but when this is set, there is a bug that will change the clock time, so it will have to be resynced. Regioning is implemented so clients can choose the area their signal floods to.</p>
